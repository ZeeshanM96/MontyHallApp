# MontyHallApp
MontyHallSimulation with C# in backend and ReactJs as frontend.

Description:
The project is a Web API that simulates the Monty Hall problem. The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario where a contestant must choose one of three doors. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two are goats. After the contestant chooses a door, the host (who knows where the car is) opens another door, revealing a goat. The contestant is then given the option to switch their choice to the remaining unopened door or stick with their original choice.

Goal:
The goal of the API is to allow users to test the probabilities associated with the Monty Hall problem, specifically examining the outcomes based on whether they choose to switch doors or stay with their original choice after one of the non-selected doors is revealed.

Technologies Used:
.NET: The project is built using the .NET framework, specifically targeting web-based applications (Web API).
Swagger: Integrated using the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package, it provides a visual interface for testing and documentation of the API.
